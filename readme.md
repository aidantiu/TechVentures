# Hello!

Welcome to TechVentures! Explore and document your tech journey with us. Share your experiences, insights, and projects as you navigate the ever-evolving world of technology

## About
TechVentures is a web-app where tech enthusiasts can document their journey through the exciting landscape of technology. Whether you're learning new programming languages, experimenting with your code, or building innovative projects, TechVentures is your space to share and learn.

## Practicing Learned Tech Stacks
Although TechVentures is designed to document your tech journey and share insights with others, the main goal of this web app is to provide you and us (developers) with a platform to practice your learned tech stacks through open-source contribution with Git and GitHub. By creating blog posts, implementing features, or improving existing code, you'll gain valuable experience in web development and collaboration.

> NOTE: App still in development
